### Lec 01: Intro&Overview

##### The Main Idea

Why? 
* Let machine gain their own experience(do trails) by itself
	* When using supervised learning, we human don't have suitable intuition about how to do something in robots' side
	  * Which makes it not practical to collect meaningful dataset manually for these tasks.
	  * Anyway we don't have a robotic finger experience when teaching robot to pick up something...
* Beyond The Human Limitations
  * Supervised by human experience, the machine may do things like human
    * But, human experience is desperately limited and anamorphic compared with the infinite *'Reality Cases'*
    * Real *'Global Searching'* for the best solution is not possible when constrained by human cognitions and experience.
  * On robots' side they may do something that goes beyond human field and may be closer to the *'Best Solution'*, or simply better that all the human imaginations before.
* It's different from classical supervised learning
  * Supervised: Impressive because it looks like something a person might do
  * Reinforcement: Impressive because no person had thought of it!

##### What?

* Mathematical formalism for learning-based decision making
* Approach for learning decision making and control from experience
* Learning & Search
  * Learning: Using data to extract *'Patterns'*
  * Search: Using computation to extract inferences
    * optimization
    * some optimization process that uses (typically iterative) computation to make rational decisions
